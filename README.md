**# Food Items Recognition on Menu-Card for Blind People using Mask-RCNN Algorithm**

*The below code demonstrate an application which is builded for Blind people specifically implemented at Restaurants, Hotels, Dhabas, Juice-Centers, etc. As we know the blind people are not able to read Menu/s, due to which they are not able to go through the entire menu and also the waiter didn't have that much sufficient time to speak out complete Menu. This application will read out the dishes names after recognizing the images of the dishes on the Menu Card using mobile speakers.*
